## Variable Declarations

In PyNot, variables are declared using the `let` keyword. By default, when you declare a variable using `let`, it is initialized with a value of 0. For example:

```pynot
let a;  // Variable 'a' is declared and initialized with the default value of 0
let b = 1;  // Variable 'b' is declared and initialized with the value 1
let c = 'Hello, World!';
```

## Data Types

PyNot supports various data types, including strings, numbers, true, false, and null, to represent a wide range of values. 
For example:

```pynot
let a = 'Hello, World!';
let b = 10;
let c = 10 + (10 * 3) + a;
let d = "Ok!";
let e = null;
let f = true;
let g = false;
```

## Build-ins
### Console Output
In PyNot, you can print to the console using the write() function. 
Here are some examples:

```pynot
let a = 'Anything';
write(a); 
write("abc");
write("write anything: ", a);
```
### String Operations
String Operations
* **`.length` Property**: To find the length of a string, use the .length property. For example:
```pynot
let a = 'abcd';
write(a.length); // This will print the length of the string.
```
* **String Indexing**: You can access individual characters within a string using square brackets. For instance:

```pynot 
let a = 'abcd';
write(a[0]); // This will print the first character 'a'.
```
