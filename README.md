# Vyzon

Vyzon is a modern programming language inspired by the elegance of Python, the flexibility of JavaScript, and the expressiveness of Ruby. It is designed with a primary focus on readability and simplicity while maintaining powerful functionality.

## Installation

To use Vyzon locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using Git:
   `git clone https://github.com/yash7xm/Vyzon.git`
2. **Change your current directory** to the cloned repository: `cd Vyzon`

3. **Make the Vyzon script executable by running the following command:** `chmod +x bin/vyzon`

## Usage

# Running a Vyzon Script from a File

1. **Create a new Vyzon file** with your code in the main directory. Name the file with a .vy extension, for example:
   `yourfile.vy`

2. **To run your Vyzon script**, execute the following command in your terminal:
   `bin/vyzon -f yourfile.vy`
   This will parse and interpret the contents of yourfile.vy.

# Running an Expression Directly

1. You can also run an expression directly from the command line by using the `-e` flag:
   `bin/vyzon -e "2 + 2"`
   This will parse and evaluate the expression `2 + 2`.

## Variable Declarations

In Vyzon, variables are declared using the `let` keyword. By default, when you declare a variable using `let`, it is initialized with a value of 0. For example:

```
let a;  // Variable 'a' is declared and initialized with the default value of 0
let b = 1;  // Variable 'b' is declared and initialized with the value 1
let c = 'Hello, World!';
```

## Data Types

Vyzon supports various data types, including `strings`, `numbers`, `true`, `false`, and `null`, to represent a wide range of values.
For example:

```
let a = 'Hello, World!';
let b = 10;
let c = 10 + (10 * 3) + a;
let d = "Ok!";
let e = null;
let f = true;
let g = false;
```

## Build-ins

### Console Output

In Vyzon, you can print to the console using the `write()` function.
Here are some examples:

```
let a = 'Anything';
write(a);
write("abc");
write("write anything: ", a);
```

### String Operations

Vyzon provides string manipulation capabilities:

-   **`.length` Property**: To find the length of a string, use the .length property. For example:

```
let a = 'abcd';
write(a.length); // This will print the length of the string.
```

-   **String Indexing**: You can access individual characters within a string using square brackets. For instance:

```
let a = 'abcd';
write(a[0]); // This will print the first character 'a'.
```

## Conditionals

Vyzon supports conditional statements for decision-making in your code. You can use the `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions. Here's an example:

```
let x = 10;

if (x > 15) {
  write("x is greater than 15");
} elif (x > 5) {
  write("x is greater than 5 but not greater than 15");
} else {
  write("x is not greater than 5");
}
```

## Loops

Vyzon supports various loop types to suit your needs. You can use `for`, `while`, and `do while` loops to control the flow of your Vyzon programs by repeating code as needed.

```
write("Using the for loop:");
for (let i=0; i<10; i+=1) {
 write("Current value of i: ", i);
}

write("Using the while loop:");
let j = 0;
while (j < 5) {
 write("Current value of j: ", j);
 j = j + 1;
}

write("Using the do-while loop:");
let k = 0;
do {
 write("Current value of k: ", k);
 k = k + 1;
} while (k < 5);
```

## Functions

You can declare functions in Vyzon using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parameters enclosed in parentheses. The function body is defined in a block. To call a function, use its name followed by parentheses, passing any required arguments.

```
def greet(name) {
  write("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("Yash"); // Calls the greet function with "Alice" as an argument.
```

## Operators

-   **Logical Operators:**
    -   The logical operators are the same as in other programming languages. Ex: `&&,||,!`
-   **Relational operators:**
    -   The relational operators are the same as in other programming languages. Ex: `<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=`
-   **Arithmetic operators:**
    -   The arithmetic operators are the same as in other programming languages. Ex: `+, -, *, /, %, ^`
-   **Assignment operators:**
    -   Assignment operators are the same as in other programming languages. Ex: `=, +=, -=, *=, /=`

### Classes and Objects

Vyzon supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes and objects.

**Defining a Class:**

You can define a class using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name. Inside the class, you can define methods (functions) and a constructor using `def`. Hereâ€™s an example:

```vyzon
class Person {
  def constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  def greet() {
    write("Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.");
  }
}

let person1 = new Person("Yash", 22);
person1.greet();
```

**Creating an Object:**
You can create an object from a class using the `new` keyword. Once an object is created, you can access its methods and properties.

### Inheritance

Vyzon allows you to extend classes through inheritance using the `extends` keyword. This allows a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class.

```
class Animal {
  def constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  def speak() {
    write(this.name + " makes a sound.");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  def constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }

  def speak() {
    write(this.name + " barks.");
  }
}

let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
dog.speak();
```

### Super

The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class and access parent methods from a child class.

```
class Parent {
  def constructor() {
    write("Parent constructor");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  def constructor() {
    super();
    write("Child constructor");
  }
}

let child = new Child();
```

### Modules

Modules in Vyzon allow you to organize and reuse code by grouping related functions or classes together. You can define a module using the `module` keyword.

```
module Math {
    def Abs(x) {
        if (x < 0) {
            return -x;
        } else {
            return x;
        }
    }
}
```

To use a function from the `Math` module:

```
write(Math.Abs(-10));  // Output: 10
```

### Importing Modules

You can import modules into your Vyzon script using the `import` statement. This allows you to reuse code from external modules.

```
import Math;
write(Math.Abs(-10));  // Output: 10
```

## Rules

1. Every statement in Vyzon should end with a semicolon `(;)` to indicate the termination of the statement.
2. Variable names in Vyzon should not start with a number.
3. All functions in Vyzon should be declared above their function calls.
