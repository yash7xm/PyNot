# PyNot 

PyNot is a modern programming language inspired by the elegance of Python, the flexibility of JavaScript, and the expressiveness of Ruby. It is designed with a primary focus on readability and simplicity while maintaining powerful functionality.
 
## Usage

To use PyNot locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using Git:
   `
   https://github.com/yash7xm/PyNot.git
   `
2. **Change your current directory** to the cloned repository: ` cd PyNot `
 
4. **Create a new PyNot file** with your code in the main directory. Name the file with a .pynot extension, for example, yourfile.pynot.

## Variable Declarations

In PyNot, variables are declared using the `let` keyword. By default, when you declare a variable using `let`, it is initialized with a value of 0. For example:

```pynot
let a;  // Variable 'a' is declared and initialized with the default value of 0
let b = 1;  // Variable 'b' is declared and initialized with the value 1
let c = 'Hello World!';
```

## Data Types in PyNot

PyNot supports various data types to represent different kinds of values. The two fundamental Boolean data types in PyNot are `true` and `false`, used to represent boolean values for logical operations.

### Boolean Data Types

- `true`: Represents a boolean value indicating true or success.

- `false`: Represents a boolean value indicating false or failure.

### Null Data Type

- `null`: Represents the absence of any value or a null value. It is commonly used to indicate that a variable or expression does not hold any meaningful data.

In PyNot, these data types are essential for making logical decisions and handling different situations in your code.
